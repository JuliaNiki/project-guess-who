# Project Name

This Guess Who game was made on week 5 for Technigo bootcamp. 
The aim of creating this game was to practice creating and manipulating objects, arrays and connecting it to the DOM.
The exciting part about this project was to plan and think about game logic, how to start, what should happen and how to interact with the user.

## The problem

I started by thinking about the game itself and then planed the different parts and steps of the game. It was challenging at some point to check if the attributes in the questions that user asked matched the attributes of the secret person because some attributes were strings and some were arrays that made it more complicated to compare. But thanks to support from code coaches at Technigo, it went smooth later on after figuring out this step. 

If I had more time I would have added some animation to the cards when flipping them.
